Build a set of models to study and test stock trading strategy: momentum strategy

0. Why am I trying to run this project?
My major is Financial Engineering and I am a big fan of data analyst and module building. But unfortunately, I could not find a job to let me explore my idea and develop myself in the direction I want, what a pity. Even though, I still want to find a place to practice my coding skills and model building abilities. I wish one day, I can become a qualified quant.
