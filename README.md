Build a set of models to study and test stock trading strategy: momentum strategy

0. Why am I trying to run this project?
My major is Financial Engineering and I am a big fan of data analyst and module building. But unfortunately, I could not find a job to let me explore my idea and develop myself in the direction I want, what a pity. Even though, I still want to find a place to practice my coding skills and model building abilities. I wish one day, I can become a qualified quant.

1. Brief Introduction
Momentum strategy should be the easiest strategy been used in the world. Its fundamental assumption is: stock price follows a constant trend. In other words, if the price has gone up for late ten days, it would be very likely to go up tomorrow.  This project will be built to spot and study this trend, train a model to use this strategy and back-testing the result.
